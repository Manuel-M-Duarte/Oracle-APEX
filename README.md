# Oracle-APEX
Exercise

In the first exercise, I couldn't replicate any error when I was Creating a new employee. The only bug that I had, was wnen I open the created Employee in the edit mode. In that situation the hired date item were expected a timestamp and not as a date (as it was on the data model).

In the exercise 2 I think I did everything that was asked on the instructions. Hope you enjoy it!

Regards!
